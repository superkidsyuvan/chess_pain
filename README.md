# Chess! ♟️

Chess but like in a single HTML file that has only 1293 lines of code (Very mischievous)

I DID NOT ADD THOSE SILLY MOVES LIKE CASTLING and 𝐸𝒩 𝒫𝒜𝒮𝒮𝒜𝒩𝒯 (I like pawn promotion though, so I added it, because it symbolises the working class rising up against oppression)

but umm yeah... You can play **Chess** *(with yourself!)*

I guess this is open-source idk (visit the cool website to play chess [here](https://superkidsyuvan.github.io/chess_pain))

I did this cuz it would be really silly

plz email me if like you want to add feature or report errors
